# README

This contains my solutions to **leetcode**, **codewars** and other code problem sites. Lately, I have been working off the ~~infamous~~ *Cracking the Coding Interview* book as practice.

I am also working on the Princeton course for algorithms in the repository located [here](https://github.com/jaabberwocky/algorithms-princeton), which is in Java.
